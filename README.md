I have also taken the responsibility of keeping our Data Fabric Dashboard up to date with the current runs. This task involves a keen eye for detail and a commitment to accuracy, ensuring that our team has access to the most recent and relevant data for our ongoing projects.

Furthermore, I have supported the sign-off process for the transformation by deep-diving into data differences found between PEG and DF. My analysis provided a better understanding of these differences, offering valuable insights that have helped our business make informed decisions. This work demonstrates my ability to navigate complex data landscapes and translate findings into meaningful business insights."

So, the final self-evaluation would now read:

"In my role as a Data Analyst on the Data Quality and Linkage team, I've had the opportunity to contribute significantly to the ICIRT project, a rating system for developers in Australia. I've taken on key responsibilities in this project, including assessing the quality of the ALarares dataset. This task required meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of data integrity.

One of my notable achievements was successfully unpacking JSON file sample responses using Python. This not only demonstrated my technical skills but also my ability to manipulate and understand complex data structures. This was a vital step in the data assessment process, as it allowed for high-level profiling of the data.

In addition to the tasks associated with the ICIRT project, I also played a crucial role in writing the metadata for the Cordell dataset. The creation of this metadata has provided a valuable resource for our team, enabling a more efficient and effective use of the dataset. This task required a deep understanding of the dataset's content and structure, as well as the ability to clearly and accurately document this information.

Furthermore, I assisted in modifying the SQL script to add more roles within the Cordell data. This task involved a deep understanding of both the Cordell dataset and SQL programming, showcasing my ability to adapt and manipulate database structures to better suit our team's needs. This modification has increased the dataset's versatility and improved our ability to analyze and draw insights from the data.

Another significant part of my work this year involved analyzing data from the Fair Trade website. I identified potential fields that could be beneficial for our business and explored how these could be linked to our commercial universe. This task required strategic thinking and a deep understanding of both our business needs and the available data.

In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this data, I went beyond the required tasks and developed a Python script to scrape the website. This proactive approach allowed for more efficient and in-depth analysis, further proving my commitment to maximizing the utility of our data resources.

Alongside my regular responsibilities, I have also been supporting the transformation team by running the analytical pipeline end-to-end. This process included the geocoding of the enquiry dataset, the creation of search keys for both the enquiry and seed datasets, and the execution of the score pipeline.

One of the challenges I faced was handling large data volumes in BigQuery, which can lead to high memory timeouts. To address this, I created temporary tables, optimizing the processing of our pipeline outputs. This solution not only prevented high memory timeouts but also improved the overall efficiency of our operations.

I have also taken the responsibility of keeping our Data Fabric Dashboard up to date with the current runs. This task involves a keen eye for detail and a commitment to accuracy, ensuring that our team has access to the most recent and relevant data for our ongoing projects.

Furthermore, I have supportedthe sign-off process for the transformation by deep-diving into data differences found between PEG and DF. My analysis provided a better understanding of these differences, offering valuable insights that have helped our business make informed decisions. This work demonstrates my ability to navigate complex data landscapes and translate findings into meaningful business insights.

These accomplishments reflect my commitment to improving data quality, my proficiency in utilizing programming languages such as Python and SQL to conduct data analysis, and my ability to innovate and problem-solve in order to optimize our operations. As we move into the second half of the year, I look forward to continuing to enhance my skills and contribute to the success of our team and the various projects we are undertaking."
